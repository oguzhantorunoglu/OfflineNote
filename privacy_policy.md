# Privacy Policy

At **OfflineNote** ("the app"), we prioritize the privacy and security of our users' data. This policy aims to inform users about how the app collects, uses, and stores data. OfflineNote is an offline note-taking application that does not share any data with third parties.

## Data Collected

**OfflineNote does not collect any personal information or data from its users.**  
The app is designed to function offline, meaning all data is stored locally on your device. It does not require an internet connection, so no information is transmitted to servers or shared with any third party.

## Data Security

OfflineNote uses **encryption methods** to protect the notes stored on your device.  
Even if someone gains access to your device, your notes will remain secure. However, it is important to note that no system is entirely immune to breaches. While OfflineNote provides encryption for your notes, users should still exercise caution regarding sensitive information.

## Data Sharing

- **In-app sharing**: OfflineNote allows users to export and import data, but this is only done locally on the device. No data is transmitted outside the device during these operations.
- **No third-party sharing**: The app does not share any personal data with third parties. Your personal information and notes remain private and secure on your device.

## Data Deletion and Disclaimer

OfflineNote stores your data locally and does not control or track how your data is transferred, deleted, or lost.  
We are not responsible for any data loss, accidental deletion of notes, or data theft resulting from unauthorized access to your device.

## User Responsibility

Users are responsible for ensuring the security of their data while using OfflineNote.  
The app offers encryption, but it is up to the users to handle their device security responsibly. Since OfflineNote operates entirely offline, users assume the risk for any security breaches or data loss on their device.

## Disclaimer of Liability

OfflineNote disclaims any responsibility for data breaches, note theft, accidental deletion, or loss of information.  
This app is a personal project and is not intended for commercial purposes. Users are fully responsible for the security of their data while using the app.
